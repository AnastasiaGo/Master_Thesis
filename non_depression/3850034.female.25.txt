      Now and then, I would do a crass (if not hilarious) Chinese adaptation of English songs. Some of my prized works include Baa Baa Black Sheep, Do-Re-Mi, and now, "Top of the World". Sing to the tune of the song! The lines don't quite rhyme but hey, the meaning does correspond. Enjoy.   Top Of The World  Such a feeling coming over me There is wonder in most everything I see  Not a cloud in the sky  Got the sun in my eyes  And I won't be surprised if it's a dream I'm on the top of the world  Looking down on creations ï¼Œ  And the only explanation I can find  It's the love that I've found  Eversince you've been around Your love puts me at the top of the world

      Escape...  into the concocted fiction of tv dramas into the arms of your imaginary perfect partner into the twilight realm of isle beach into the breezy car ride along ECP into the warmth of your comforter into the unbridled surf in your dreams into the make-believe fantasy of tall stories  where who you are does not matter where what you can do is unrestrained where how achieved you are is of no concern where life's many questions need no answers where the colours you see are richer and warmer where weight defies gravity where you are the lead you want to be.
