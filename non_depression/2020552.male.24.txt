      My internship will start tomorrow.  It sounds like a really intense place, so i'm nervous about the whole thing.  i've always fit in in office enviros really well, and i've tended to do well in those places.  i think i'll be sucessful.  i also don't think its going to be very hard at all.  i'll post tomorrow to let everyone know how it went.

      This week was somewhat of a breakthrough in the jobsearch.  I even got an offer for a job I had to refuse.  On Tuesday I got two phonecalls.  One was from Turning the Page, an organization that does professional development for teachers and connects communities to schools.  They were calling for a second interview.  The other was from Hispanic CREO, a group that advocates for school choice reforms.  They offered me a (well) paid internship until something else comes up.   I had my TTP interview yesterday, and I think it went really well.  I don't want to count my eggs before they hatch, though.  I have no idea what my competition looks like!

      Below you'll find a pic of the place we now call home.  Its in Takoma Park - what I consider to be the finest subset of DC.  We're in a real neighborhood, with friendly neighbors and treelined streets, but we're still a 4 min walk from the metro, and a 20 min ride from downtown.  It comes at a price, though, and there are a few things wrong with the house.  In fact, I'm about to go check to ensure the basement didn't flood last night!  That said, I couldn't be happier with it.  Don't you love our faux stone?

      Welcome to my blog.  My ambition is to record my thoughts and ideas as I find a job, explore dc, and hopefully come across a partner in crime.  It'll be more or less unedited... just pure musings.  enjoy.
